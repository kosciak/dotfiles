# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
